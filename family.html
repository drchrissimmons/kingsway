        <h4>The Apple Tree Project</h4>
        <p>Each year Kingsway Outreach serves as host site for the Apple Tree Project, which provides Christmas gifts for the children of incarcerated parents.  People are encouraged to pick “apples” with the name and wished-for items for a specific child.  The "apples" are made available through churches, the Kingsway office, and other venues.  Donors purchase the wished-for gifts and return them unwrapped, along with a donation for shipping, to the Kingsway office or designated location by a specified date in time for delivery by ministry volunteers.  Volunteers wrap the presents and prepares them for shipment.  The presents are delivered by volunteers or shipped via UPS to the children in time for Christmas.
        <br><strong>Donations accepted through the year</strong></p>
        <h6>We share this message so you will see the impact of the Apple Tree Project:
            "Today when I got home from work, I had a box waiting on the porch. When I opened the box, there were wrapped gifts for my granddaughter. Her mother is currently incarcerated in Fluvanna serving a sentence for attempting to murder my son. My granddaughter loves her mom and asks for her daily. I want to thank you for taking the time to send gifts to my granddaughter on behalf of her mother. She will be so happy Christmas morning! I have always prided myself for trying to help our community and giving to those less fortunate and today I cried when I opened that box and was on the receiving end of such a generous gesture. Thank you for all that you do!!" (from Jill)  December 2018</h6>
