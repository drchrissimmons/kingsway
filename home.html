    <p>"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,  I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."  Matthew 25: 35-36</p>
    <h4>Notes from Louise Jennings, Director:</h4>
    <p>From Louise Jennings, Director: Please join me in prayer at 9:00 PM daily to pray for our President and for our country, and to pray that this virus be eradicated from our land.<br>

    "Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land." 2Chronicles 7:14.<br>
        
    Please be in prayer for the incarcerated men and women who may be feeling helpless for their loved ones. Pray also for the chaplains and prison staff as they serve the "least of these" (Matt 25:40).
